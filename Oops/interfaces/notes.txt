1)abstract : means internal functionality hide, abstract keyword is used with class and method
abstract methods don't have body.

- if method single method is abstract in a class than class will also be abstract.
- Object of abstract class is not possible , we can use it only by inheritance 
- or in new versions if you want to make object of abstract class than you need to use anonymous way

2)Interface: collections of abstract methods, all method are by default abstract
- interface keyword is used to make an interface and a class will use implement the interface using implement keyword.

-by default variable in interface are public static final 
-object of interface class can be only by anonymous way.but in that need to give body to everything
-static methods body is possible in interface after java8

3)final : final variable will become constant , final class will not be inherited, final method can't be override
