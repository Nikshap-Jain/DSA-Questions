sliding window is the problem solving technique.

1) if input is array or string with number k (with condition of various kind like maxima or minima or on k etc) and we need to work on subarray or substring than question might be of sliding window.

- Question can be of fixed size and variable size

2)There are two steps of sliding window of fixed size - i) Calculate first window ans ii) grow,shrink,update ans

3)There are three steps to solve sw of variable size i ) grow ii) shrink iii) cal ans

like - fi = 0, ei = 0; ans = 0, while (ei < length && fi <= ei){
    grow
    shrink
    ans 
}

ex - MaxSumOfWindowSizeK.java

class Solution {
    public int slidingWindowTemplate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int l = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int ans = 0;

        // 1. Always expand 'r' (right pointer) one by one
        for (int r = 0; r < nums.length; r++) {
            // Add the new element to the window
            sum += nums[r];

            // 2. Shrink 'l' (left pointer) IF sum becomes too big
            // (Note: This only works if numbers are positive!)
            while (sum > k && l <= r) {
                sum -= nums[l];
                l++;
            }

            // 3. Check if we found the target
            if (sum == k) {
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

3) variable size window

si = 0, ei = 0
- while (ei < n){
    //grow
    //Shriñk
    do something with si 
    //ansCalculate

    ei++
}


Key Takeaway
The question to always ask yourself is:

"If I add one element to the right or remove one element from the left, can I update my window's condition in O(1) time?"

If the answer is no (either because of negative numbers or a complex check like a palindrome), it's probably a trap.
