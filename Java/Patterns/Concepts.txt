Approach 

- first we initialize 
n which is total number of rows 
star which is total star in the first rows
spaces (total space in first row)
rows which is 1 

procedure - 

there will be always outer loop which is for number of rows. 
then we will see how many tasks are there in a single line of pattern if two then outer loop will contain two loops 

ex- three task in the row

while (row <= n){
    //loop for stars

    //loop for space

    //loop for stars

    //updations like row++ , star--, space +=2 etc.
}

*)Mirroring - In star we do horizontal mirroring (just if & else condition after row exceeds where mirroring taking place just reverse the condition) and in numbers we do vertical mirroring
