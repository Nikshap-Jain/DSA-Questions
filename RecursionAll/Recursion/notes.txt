0)Its like we do first task than ask recursion to do the rest. whenever we have choices we use recursion.

1) Ex - factorial , here we have two choices so we need two recursive calls.

2)To understand recursion understand to find sub sequence of the string. In that just think how you can print 1st level that is (a and blank) . rest recursion will do don't think about that.Don't think about inner working just think about first level.

ex - in printing all subsequence of String - first level : add or not (first alphabet) than for second level there is again two choice add second alphabet or not so on until string blank.

3)Find count of something suppose subsequence using recursion. - Take static global variable.

4)anything which we do with argument in recursive call like add or sub than , argument value only change for next frame , for current frame its still the same.

5)Time complexity 

*)if one recursive call
- count number of frames created generally n so time complexity is O(n) if there is constant operations in each frame .
- suppose in each frame we are running a loop for eachframe its doing separate work than its O(n ^ 2).


*)if more than one recursive call
- number of call power N ex - 2 calls in fibo so tc is 2 ^ N.

*)when i know what exactly the number of choices than only recursion is enough use loop only when choices are variable or exact number of choices are many but path forward is simple like n - 1.
