1) Constrains - NOt null , unique, 

primary key can be combination of two columns

- create table temp(
    id int,
    name varchar(40), 
    rollNo int,
    Primary Key (id, rollNo)
);

foreign key, : Prevents actions that destroy links between tables
 create table temp(
    id int,
    name varchar(40), 
    rollNo int,
    Foreign Key (id) references TAbleName(primary key of tableName)
);

=> table which contain foreign key is called child table and table which contain this foreign key as primary key is parent table.
=>an action performed on a row in the parent table (which contains the primary key) is automatically propagated to the related rows in the child table (which contains the foreign key)

create table temp(
    id int,
    name varchar(40), 
    rollNo int,
    Foreign Key (id) references TAbleName(primary key of tableName),
    cascade on update,// automatically child (temp) mai update hojayega agr parent mai kuch changes honge primary key mai
    cascade on delete, // agr pk from parent mai kuch delete hua toh vo records(rows) yaha bhi delete hojayenge pure.
);


Check :

ex - create table temp(
    id int,
    name varchar(40), 
    age int,
    Constraint anyName CHECK (age >= 18 AND id = 12)
);

- create table temp(
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18)
);


*)Limit clause 
Select column form table LIMIT 3; give only three rows of the given table

*)Group by clause
- group the rows which contains same value based on a specific column (we want)

- Select city , count(name) from student
group by city; // row whose city value are same will be grouped like Delhi ka ek group bn jayega and un name ka count mil jayega jaha city mai Delhi hai.

- ab yaha jo bhi column select ke sath mentioned hoge jispr aggregate function nhi lga vaha group by lgana zaruri hai vrna error ayega

*)Having
- Where can't be apply on group so Having is use to apply condition on group .
The Rule: If you use GROUP BY, every column in your SELECT or HAVING clause must either be:
Inside the GROUP BY clause (like item).

Inside an aggregate function (like MAX(), SUM(), COUNT()).

-Select item , count(amount) from Orders 
Where amount >= 300
Group by item
Having Max(customer_id) > 3; 

column used in Having will always in group by else it should be in aggregate function.

-Select item , count(amount) from Orders 
Where amount >= 300
Group by item
Having item > 3; //item is in GROUP BY so we are able to use as it is because grouping already hogyi aggregate se grouping krane ki zaurat ni hai 

Where Conditons on rows and Having put conditions on groups--

*)order- 

- Select
-Where
- Group by
- Having
-Order by DESC


*)"DELETE is a DML command that scans the table and removes rows one by one, recording each in the transaction log, which makes it slower but allows for rollbacks. TRUNCATE is a DDL command that deallocates the data pages entirely, making it much faster, but it resets the Identity (Auto-increment) keys and usually cannot be rolled back easily."


*)Joins - combine rows based on same coloumn

*)inner join - intersection of two tables

Select * from Orders
inner join Customers
on Orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

Select Customers.first_name , Orders.item 
from customers
inner join orders
on customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

*)left join - tableA ke saare and tableB ke only vo jo similar hai
